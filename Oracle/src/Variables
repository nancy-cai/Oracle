Local Variables: within a method, constructor and block;
                 Access modifiers cannot be used for local variables;
                 Cannot use the keywords that instance and class variables use;
                 Must assign a value cuz no default value for local v.

Field/Instance/Member Variables: Within a class but outside methods,constr and blocks;
                           Access modifiers can be given for instance variables;
                           Have default value;
                           Can use final,volatile, transient, strict;
                      
Class/static variables:Declared with the static keyword in a class, but outside a method, constr or a block;
                       Constants are variables that are declared as public/private, final and static;
                       Have default value;
                       Can be accessed by calling with the class name ClassName.VariableName;
                       i.e. public final static c. This is a public constant.
